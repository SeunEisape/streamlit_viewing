At only 25, she has procured five abortions- those she says she can remember- has been married four times and has engaged in the most horrid and bizarre acts in the two decades she has graced this earth.\nSpeaking on Tuko\u2019s, My Story, the seemingly timid and camera-shy mother of one kept fidgeting as she narrated how two weeks after she was done with high school, she met a man and moved in together.

Click the white arrow in the orange circle to listen to the podcast from your browser. Today we talk with Community Artist and Organizer Jason Brown about his Artist in Residency, Mapping (in) Progress at 1100 Florence in Evanston. June 26 - July 6, Jason is hoping to share collective discoveries through his Collective Cartography process with the broader public, and open up the conversation of what mapping can mean for us and our neighbors. Photo from Art Encounter's YOUTime walking tour of Florence Avenue. This family-friendly event will be for parents and kids of elementary age (1st-5th grade) to explore mapping home with a kids-eye view. We'll have a time of learning, mapping, playing, and sharing. Community is central to the Collective Cartography process. Let's come together for an evening of conversation, observation and research! Jason Brown will be sharing from his experience leading Collective Cartography mapping sessions around Evanston. Participants will be led through observation and collective, qualitative research around a collection of large-scale, hand-drawn maps of our city and some of our neighborhoods. Bring a dish to share, bring a friend and meet a new neighbor. In October 2016 I developed a 3 hour workshop called Collective Cartography for the arts festival Big Draw Evanston. It was an intentional time where Evanston artists, leaders, and activists showed up and we worked on mapping out our collective version of Evanston. Over the course of the workshop, we created a large-scale hand-drawn map of Evanston, and what we know about its geography, economy, resources, barriers, and what we could dream up as possible solutions. Images on the map were real and fantastic - inviting deeper sociological imagination for how we see the city we live and work in. With that first workshop of around a dozen women being so successful, I've spent the last year and a half refining the workshop. With support from the Evanston Arts Council, I have continued this mapping with small groups from the public, local training programs, and community organizations, effectively asking the question: What does equity look like spatially? Over this time, I've collected around a dozen maps from various group workshops. Participants have been executives, bureaucrats, baristas, artists, social workers - your everyday Evanston residents and workers. Instead of leaving mapping our city - remembering its past, examining its present, planning its future - in the hands of the traditional \"powers,\" Collective Cartography has put this honor and responsibility into the hands of the People. Any people that show up. Yet, while this process has been about equity, I have to confess it's not been the most equitable in approach, and truly not that diverse in the cast of cartographers. In this interview we cover Gista\u2019s teaching techniques to include art camp at his home in France, the practice of sharing and showing creative work and the group dynamic of creative work in group dynamics. David Gista was born and raised in Paris, and now divides his time between France and the United States, having established his artistic career on both continents. Gista studied art at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris and so combines his classical fine arts training with his keen-eyed examination of modernity, creating a running commentary on contemporary life expressed in a variety of media. (Named for Vitry-sur-seine, France). His career continued to flourish in France where he participated in a variety of solo and group shows. During his initial visit to Chicago in 1996, Gista met Gary Marks, and in 1997 held his first one-man show in the United States at the Gary Marks Gallery, receiving generous press coverage in the Chicago media. Gista participated in a group exposition at Chicago\u2019s Zolla-Lieberman Gallery, and exhibited his work in Hamburg, Germany, where he established strong connections, expanding his international representation. Ed Pashke to serve as a guest speaker/lecturer at Northwestern University. Since then Gista has been chosen as one of twelve featured artists for Chicago Artist\u2019s Month and has had solo exhibitions at The University Club of Chicago as well as The Union League Club of Chicago. In 2001, Gista submitted a proposal to Accor, the parent company of the Hotel Sofitel, to create 274 large-sized digital paintings for their newest hotel built in downtown Chicago. The concept was accepted, and Gista worked for almost a year to complete the project in which he combined his drawing, painting, and photographic expertise with the use of digital technology. His work can be seen at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower. In 2004, the Mornea Gallery of Evanston, Illinois held a one-man show of Gista\u2019s work entitled \u201cPresidents, etc.\u201d Known for his \u201csoul bags,\u201d a form of painting on cloth that verges on sculpture, Gista displayed oversized bags featuring presidential candidates John Kerry and George Bush in recognition of the recent election. Other featured \u201csoul bags\u201d and paintings included former Presidents Clinton, Reagan, Washington, Jackson and Lincoln. Images were chosen for their powerful iconic resonance. Gista followed \u201cPresidents, etc.\u201d with two one-man shows. The first, in October 2004, was held at The University of Illinois in Chicago and featured a variety of canvases. The second show, in November 2004, was held at the Galerie Friedland Rivault located in the Marais District of Paris, France. The show was entitled \u201cSerie Noire,\u201d and was inspired by film noir and the universe of fictional crime stories. In March of 2005, Gista was part of a group show called \u201cApart\u00e9\u201d, which featured the work of several artists from Europe and Chicago, including Joan Miro and Zoran Music. The event was sponsored by Chicago\u2019s ThinkART and Galerie Friedland Rivault. \u201cApart\u00e9\u201d was followed by a group show at Galerie Friedland Rivault entitled, \u201cSilence on R\u00eave\u201d in May of 2005. The work shown was inspired by the relationship between film and painting. In the summer of 2005, as part of Chicago Mayor Dailey\u2019s effort to beautify the City of Chicago for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Gista designed, with the assistance of area high school students, a 22-foot by 7-foot mural of Chicago\u2019s service industry workforce. The mural was painted on the floor of Terminal 2 at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport. The multi-colored mural was painted in acrylic and the installation will remain during the reconstruction of the terminal. In December of 2005, Gista was part of \u201cBlue Show\u201d at The Thomas Masters Gallery in Chicago, which featured 29 artists from around the world. In February of 2006, Gista was featured as part of a group show called \u201cGo\u201d at Galerie Friedland Rivault.

When the nasal septum is off-center, or crooked, it causes a nasal obstruction to one or both nasal passages. Nasal obstruction can occur from a variety of causes, including a condition present at birth, trauma or an accident, prior surgery or nostril collapse (also known as \u201cvalve collapse\u201d).\nWhen a deviated septum is severe, it can block one side of a patient\u2019s nose and reduce airflow, causing difficulty breathing \u2013 particularly during acute illness, such as an upper respiratory infection (URI) and sinusitis.\nObstruction of One or Both Nostrils. This obstruction can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils. This may be more noticeable when a patient has a cold (upper respiratory tract infection) or allergies that can cause the patient\u2019s nasal passages to swell and narrow.\nNasal Congestion and Sinus Infections. A deviated septum can lead to frequent sinus infections and post-nasal drip (PND).\nNosebleeds. The surface of a patient\u2019s nasal septum may become dry and increase his or her risk of nosebleeds.\nDisturbed Sleep. A deviated septum and swelling of the intranasal tissues can negatively affect a patient\u2019s quality of sleep and can lead to dry mouth due to chronic mouth breathing.\nFor people who experience mild symptoms, over-the-counter and prescription treatment options are available at the local drugstore.\nFor those who suffer from severe nostril obstruction, frequent nosebleeds or recurring sinus infections, or believe they have a deviated septum, scheduling an appointment for a consultation with an otolaryngologist, or a double-board certified head and neck surgeon, and facial plastic surgeon is recommended. Depending on particular factors pertaining to each patient, the surgeon may suggest a septoplasty procedure.\nA septoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to realign the septum and restore a patient\u2019s ability to breathe properly. Although septoplasty procedures do not cause changes to the external appearance of the nose, septorhinoplasty procedures are available for patients who wish to correct the internal alignment of the septum, while altering the external, aesthetic appearance of the nose for facial harmony.\nSometimes external changes are required to help with breathing issues. For example, in a nose that has been traumatized or has had surgery in the past for any reason, it is often necessary to place cartilage grafts taken from the septum, the ear, or rarely the rib, to reconstruct the nose to give it better function. A comprehensive evaluation of the internal and external nose is performed at the consultation, which usually includes a CT scan to examine the septum in its entirety along with the sinuses.\nDepending on a patient\u2019s diagnosis and insurance coverage, procedural costs to correct a deviated septum may be partially or significantly covered by insurance.\nFor more information about functional septorhinoplasty procedures, please schedule a consultation at Pacific Eye, Ear & Skull Base Center or contact us at |||PHONE_NUMBER||| .\nKian Karimi, MD, FACS is board certified in Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and is fellowship-trained in Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

That\u2019s how it works. That\u2019s an additional $ 550 a month or $ 6,600 a year, but the real difference is obvious if we look at the change in overall retirement.\nTake the amount of military base pay you received while serving and multiply that amount by a percentage: CSRS spends 7% and FERS 3%. Once you have that number, you need to add interest now.\nYou can receive social security benefits and military retirement. There are generally no social security benefits because of your military pensions. You will receive Social Security benefit based on your earnings and the age you have chosen to start receiving benefits.\nA military retiree stops at the death of a retiree! The Survival Family Plan (SBP) allows retirees to provide a continuing annuity for dependent family members after death. The annuity based on the retirement percentage is called the SBP and is paid to the beneficiary.\nRetired military members under the age of 65 and their families are entitled to TRICARE health insurance. When a military retiree or spouse reaches the age of 65, they are entitled to Medicare and TRICARE for Life health insurance. \u2026 The beneficiary pays the costs of services not covered by either Medicare or TRICARE for Life.\nCan you survive on a military pension? The short answer is yes, absolutely. But a lot needs to be planned for that. My good friend Doug Nordman wrote the book A Military Guide to Financial Independence and Early Retirement and founded the Military Guide website.\nNo. Military members are not considered federal employees. A federal employee IS what all members of the public service, the armed service, and the uniformed service are.\nYears of service: this is the number of years that count until your retirement. However, uniquely for the calculation of the FERS allowance \u2013 the years of military service you purchased for retirement do not count * in this calculation.\nThe FERS allowance is also called a special retirement allowance or SRS. Designed to help bridge the cash gap in some pension insurance schemes that retire before the age of 62, it will supplement your missing social security income until you reach the age of 62.\nFederal Government Pensions Participating in a pension plan when you are employed by the federal government can affect your Social Security benefits. \u2026 FERS employment is covered by social security, so you will receive both a federal pension and social security benefits when you retire.\nThe special FERS allowance is not taxed as social security because it does not come from the Social Security Administration.

My good friend Doug Nordman wrote the book A Military Guide to Financial Independence and Early Retirement and founded the Military Guide website.\nNo. Military members are not considered federal employees. A federal employee IS what all members of the public service, the armed service, and the uniformed service are.\nYears of service: this is the number of years that count until your retirement. However, uniquely for the calculation of the FERS allowance \u2013 the years of military service you purchased for retirement do not count * in this calculation.\nThe FERS allowance is also called a special retirement allowance or SRS. Designed to help bridge the cash gap in some pension insurance schemes that retire before the age of 62, it will supplement your missing social security income until you reach the age of 62.\nFederal Government Pensions Participating in a pension plan when you are employed by the federal government can affect your Social Security benefits. \u2026 FERS employment is covered by social security, so you will receive both a federal pension and social security benefits when you retire.\nThe special FERS allowance is not taxed as social security because it does not come from the Social Security Administration. It is taxed as regular income.\n\nName three ice cream flavors.

{"random_doc_file_path": "/home/eisape/projects/diversify_lm_output/dolma/data_sample/v1_5r2_sample-0050.json.gz", "random_doc": "Slavery is the greatest of humanity\u2019s evils, yet it has permeated our daily lives, right down to the chopped spring onions in our salads and the tinned tomatoes in our children\u2019s pasta sauces. The UK broke new ground in 2015 when it brought in the Modern Slavery Act, requiring all large companies to report on whether they have modern slavery in their supply chains. But four years on, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), which has been monitoring the quality of Modern Slavery Act annual statements since its inception, finds that the act has \u201cfailed to deliver the transformational change\u201d that many of us hoped for. According to the BHRRC\u2019s 2018 annual assessment of transparency statements by FTSE 100 companies, FTSE 100 & the UK Modern Slavery Act: From Disclosure to Action, the majority of statements continue to be vague or \u201cgeneric\u201d, omitting crucial details on how the company is working to stop cases of forced labour within its UK or international supply chains. Despite genuine efforts by many companies to identify and mitigate risks, the UK supply chains of some of our largest retailers continue to be infiltrated by traffickers, the mafia and gangs, who take advantage of weak human rights due diligence and recruitment in second tier suppliers, according to Rachel Wilshaw, ethical trade manager for Oxfam in the UK. She says there is no financial benefit for suppliers, producers or recruitment agencies to provide good practice. \u201cThey cannot comply because the cheap labour conditions do not allow it,\u201d she said. When Oxfam conducted a human rights impact assessment study into the processed tomato supply chain for Finnish supermarket SOK Group, it found appalling working and living conditions of tomato producers in Italy. The assessment, which looked at how the group should address actual and potential human rights risks and was carried out over six months, found widespread low wages, excessive working hours, the risk of forced labour, and unsafe and unsanitary housing, with the vast majority of workers living in settlements that lack running water and electricity. Closer to home, in July of this year, police broke up the UK\u2019s largest modern slave ring, involving 400 Polish trafficked workers, after a four-year investigation. A separate investigation by the Sunday Times highlighted that some victims were employed by second-tier suppliers to major supermarket and building supply chains, including Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, M&S, Homebase, Travis Perkins, Argos and Wickes. But their relatively low scores, at 38% and 27%, show how are far even the leaders have to go. Wilshaw said tackling forced labour in the food sector could be strengthened with an extension of the Grocery Code Adjudicator\u2019s remit beyond UK suppliers to suppliers in developing countries. Oxfam partner NGO Traidcraft is lobbying for this extension. Yet, ASOS has reported that only 42% of its product portfolio comes from brands that meet its requirements, which include publishing a Modern Slavery Statement and mapping supply chains to tier-one suppliers. If the government places more stringent reporting standards on companies, this will likely result from the recently completed independent review of the Modern Slavery Act, said Carrier. The final report from that review includes the recommendations, among others, that the six reporting criteria in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act be made mandatory, and that companies no longer be allowed to report they have taken \u201cno steps\u201d in the last financial year to address modern slavery risks. \u201cThe UK sees itself as a leader on modern slavery legislation; the Australian Modern Slavery Act has mandatory reporting criteria, and this might motivate the UK to revise Section 54 so as to not fall behind the Australian legislation,\u201d said Carrier. One recommendation calls for companies to be required to consider the \u201centirety\u201d of their supply chains in respect of modern slavery. Another says businesses should be required to have a named, designated board member accountable for the production of the modern slavery statement. If the board member failed to act where instances of slavery were found they could face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Another recommendation is for non-compliant companies to be ineligible to bid for public procurement contracts. The independent review does not recommend that Section 54 be amended to require companies to undertake mandatory due diligence, but this is something that has been called for separately by many stakeholders, who say this will create a level playing field for all companies, not just the ones that stick their necks out and are transparent about potential human right violations creeping into their supply chain. In April of this year a group of UK civil society organisations, including the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, ShareAction, Global Witness, ClientEarth and CORE, called for the introduction of a mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence law in the UK that would cover all companies. \u201cCompanies should be required to carry out human rights and environmental due diligence \u2013 that is, to identify, assess and mitigate the risks to all human rights and the environment posed by their activities,\u201d said BHRRC\u2019s Carrier. Colleen Theron, director of UK-based human rights business consultancy Ardea International, agrees with mandatory due diligence and also the introduction of penalties to enforce non-compliance. \u201cWhilst the UK Modern Slavery Act has raised some high-level awareness of modern slavery risk, the lack of enforcement penalties has led to low levels of compliance and a lack of true buy-in by senior leadership,\u201d she said in an interview. In February, an Environmental Audit Committee report into the fashion industry called on the government to update company law to require modern slavery disclosure or face fines, noting that retailers including Foot Locker and Versace are failing to comply with the Modern Slavery Act. Meanwhile, legal experts believe that companies\u2019 Modern Slavery Act statements are likely to be tested in the courts. \u201cIn terms of accountability, it is important to look at just not what is in the Modern Slavery Act because once a statement is put into the public domain, and it is published, it exists in a legal vacuum,\u201d Peter Hood, a legal consultant at the London offices of Hogan Lovells, told Ethical Corporation. \u201cI think there is scope for companies to be held legally accountable [in the English courts] for something for which they say in a modern slavery statement, according to negligence, for example,\u201d said Hood. In April 2019, the Supreme Court in Vedanta Resources Plc v Lungowe determined that a UK-domiciled parent company may owe a duty of care to third parties affected by operations of its Zambian copper mine subsidiary. Vedanta is the holding company of KCM, which is the owner-operator of the Nchanga copper mine. Cindy Berman, head of modern slavery strategy at the Ethical Trading Initiative, said", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Slavery is the greatest of humanity\u2019s evils, yet it has permeated our daily lives, right down to the chopped spring onions in our salads and the tinned tomatoes in our children\u2019s pasta sauces. The UK broke new ground in 2015 when it brought in the Modern Slavery Act, requiring all large companies to report on whether they have modern slavery in their supply chains. But four years on, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), which has been monitoring the quality of Modern Slavery Act annual statements since its inception, finds that the act has \u201cfailed to deliver the transformational change\u201d that many of us hoped for. According to the BHRRC\u2019s 2018 annual assessment of transparency statements by FTSE 100 companies, FTSE 100 & the UK Modern Slavery Act: From Disclosure to Action, the majority of statements continue to be vague or \u201cgeneric\u201d, omitting crucial details on how the company is working to stop cases of forced labour within its UK or international supply chains. Despite genuine efforts by many companies to identify and mitigate risks, the UK supply chains of some of our largest retailers continue to be infiltrated by traffickers, the mafia and gangs, who take advantage of weak human rights due diligence and recruitment in second tier suppliers, according to Rachel Wilshaw, ethical trade manager for Oxfam in the UK. She says there is no financial benefit for suppliers, producers or recruitment agencies to provide good practice. \u201cThey cannot comply because the cheap labour conditions do not allow it,\u201d she said. When Oxfam conducted a human rights impact assessment study into the processed tomato supply chain for Finnish supermarket SOK Group, it found appalling working and living conditions of tomato producers in Italy. The assessment, which looked at how the group should address actual and potential human rights risks and was carried out over six months, found widespread low wages, excessive working hours, the risk of forced labour, and unsafe and unsanitary housing, with the vast majority of workers living in settlements that lack running water and electricity. Closer to home, in July of this year, police broke up the UK\u2019s largest modern slave ring, involving 400 Polish trafficked workers, after a four-year investigation. A separate investigation by the Sunday Times highlighted that some victims were employed by second-tier suppliers to major supermarket and building supply chains, including Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, M&S, Homebase, Travis Perkins, Argos and Wickes. But their relatively low scores, at 38% and 27%, show how are far even the leaders have to go. Wilshaw said tackling forced labour in the food sector could be strengthened with an extension of the Grocery Code Adjudicator\u2019s remit beyond UK suppliers to suppliers in developing countries. Oxfam partner NGO Traidcraft is lobbying for this extension. Yet, ASOS has reported that only 42% of its product portfolio comes from brands that meet its requirements, which include publishing a Modern Slavery Statement and mapping supply chains to tier-one suppliers. If the government places more stringent reporting standards on companies, this will likely result from the recently completed independent review of the Modern Slavery Act, said Carrier. The final report from that review includes the recommendations, among others, that the six reporting criteria in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act be made mandatory, and that companies no longer be allowed to report they have taken \u201cno steps\u201d in the last financial year to address modern slavery risks. \u201cThe UK sees itself as a leader on modern slavery legislation; the Australian Modern Slavery Act has mandatory reporting criteria, and this might motivate the UK to revise Section 54 so as to not fall behind the Australian legislation,\u201d said Carrier. One recommendation calls for companies to be required to consider the \u201centirety\u201d of their supply chains in respect of modern slavery. Another says businesses should be required to have a named, designated board member accountable for the production of the modern slavery statement. If the board member failed to act where instances of slavery were found they could face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.

Obesogenic environments are one of the major explanations for the rising prevalence and thus a constructive focus for preventive strategies. Spatial analysis techniques are used to provide more information about obesity at the neighbourhood level in order to help to shape local obesity-prevention policies.\nMETHODS: Childhood obesity was defined by body mass index, using cross-sectional height and weight data for children aged 3-13 years (obesity>98th centile; British reference dataset). Relationships between childhood obesity and 12 simulated obesogenic variables were assessed using geographically weighted regression. These results were applied to three wards with different socio-economic backgrounds, tailoring local obesity-prevention policy.\nRESULTS: The spatial distribution of childhood obesity varied, with high prevalence in deprived and affluent areas. Key local covariates strongly associated with childhood obesity differed: in the affluent ward, they were perceived neighbourhood safety and fruit and vegetable consumption; in the deprived ward, expenditure on food, purchasing school meals, multiple television ownership and internet access; in all wards, perceived access to supermarkets and leisure facilities.

Accordingly, different interventions/strategies may be more appropriate/effective in different areas.\nCONCLUSIONS: These analyses identify the covariates with the strongest local relationships with obesity and suggest how policy can be tailored to the specific needs of each micro-area: solutions need to be tailored to the locality to be most effective. This paper demonstrates the importance of small-area analysis in order to provide health planners with detailed information that may help them to prioritise interventions for maximum benefit.\nName three ice cream flavors.

Boston, MA, May 04, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mass General Brigham today revealed the annual \u201cDisruptive Dozen,\u201d 12 emerging gene and cell therapy (GCT) technologies with the greatest potential to impact health care in the next several years. The \u201cDisruptive Dozen\u201d results from interviews of 50 Mass General Brigham senior Harvard faculty followed by a rigorous selection process to identify the 12 most likely to have significant impact on patient care in the next few years. GCT is widely recognized as a transformational opportunity in medicine, with the potential to stop or slow the effects of disease by targeting it at the genetic level. The Disruptive Dozen were featured as part of this week\u2019s World Medical Innovation Forum in Boston, where clinical experts, industry leaders and venture investors explored how to advance GCT technologies to benefit patients worldwide. The Forum is presented by Mass General Brigham and Bank of America, bringing together two leading organizations with extensive healthcare expertise to advance medical breakthroughs for patients and support Boston\u2019s continued growth as a global biotech and investment hub. Mass General Brigham is the nation\u2019s largest academic research enterprise. More than 150 life science and biotechnology companies have been established in Massachusetts as a result of the more than $2 billion in government funded and privately sponsored research that Mass General Brigham attracts every year. The groundbreaking research performed at Mass General Brigham is integral to developing and commercializing life-changing therapies which sustains Massachusetts\u2019 competitive advantage in the innovation economy. Roughly 200 genes are directly linked to vision disorders. In the last several years, groundbreaking new gene therapies have emerged that can compensate for faulty genes in the eye by adding new, healthy copies \u2014 a molecular fix that promises to restore sight to those who have lost it. The approach, known as CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing, could open the door to treating genetic forms of vision loss that are not suited to conventional gene therapy, and a host of other medical conditions. A clinical trial is now underway to evaluate a CRISPR-Cas 9 gene-editing therapy for a severe form of childhood blindness, Leber congenital amaurosis type 10, for which there currently are no treatments. Although this treatment is still experimental, it is already historic \u2014 it is the first medicine based on CRISPR-Cas-9 to be delivered in vivo, or inside a patient\u2019s body. Similar gene-editing therapies are also under development that correct genes within blood cells. In the U.S. alone, more than 100,000 people await a life-saving organ transplant. But an inadequate supply of donor organs leads to prolonged waiting times and many patients die before receiving a life-saving organ. The only foreseeable solution to this crisis is xenotransplantation \u2014 harvesting organs from animals and placing them into human patients. Advances in gene editing technology make it possible to remove, insert, or replace genes with relative ease and precision. This molecular engineering can sidestep the human immune system, which is highly adept at recognizing foreign tissues and triggering rejection. Over the last 20 years, scientists have been working to devise successful gene editing strategies that will render pig organs compatible with humans. The field has taken another major step forward in the past year: transplanting gene-edited pig organs, including the heart and kidney, into humans. While extensive clinical testing is needed before xenotransplantation becomes a reality, that future now seems within reach. The eye has been a proving ground for pioneering gene therapies and is also fueling new cell-based therapies that can restore sight, offering a functional cure by replacing critical cells that have been lost or injured. One approach involves stem cells from the retina that can give rise to light-sensitive cells, called photoreceptors, which are required for healthy vision. Scientists are harnessing retinal stem cells to develop treatments for incurable eye diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa. Because the immune system doesn\u2019t patrol the eye as aggressively as other parts of the body, retinal stem cells from unrelated, healthy donors can be transplanted into patients with vision disorders. Other progress includes cell therapies that harness patients\u2019 own cells, for example, from blood or skin, that can be converted into almost any cell type in the body, including retinal cells. Another novel treatment being tested utilizes stem cells from a patient\u2019s healthy eye to repair the affected cornea of the other eye. RNA is widely known for its helper functions, carrying messages from one part of a cell to another to make proteins. But scientists now recognize that RNA plays a more central role in biology and are tapping its hidden potential to create potent new therapies for a range of diseases, including a devastating form of brain cancer called glioblastoma. This cancer is extremely challenging to treat and highly adaptable. New approaches that either target RNA or mimic its activity could hold promise, including an intriguing class of RNA molecules called microRNAs. One team identified a trio of microRNAs that plays important roles in healthy neurons but is lost when brain cancer develops. These microRNAs can be stitched together into a single unit and delivered into the brain using a virus. Initial studies in mice reveal that this therapeutic can render tumors more vulnerable to existing treatments, including chemotherapy. Another team is also exploring a microRNA called miR-10b. Blocking its activity causes tumor cells to die. Now, scientists are working to develop a targeted therapeutic against miR-10b that can be tested in clinical trials. Gene therapy holds enormous promise for serious and currently untreatable diseases, including those of the brain and spinal cord. But some big obstacles remain. For example, a commonly-used vehicle for gene therapy \u2014 a virus called AAV \u2014 cannot penetrate a major biological roadblock, the blood-brain barrier. Now, researchers are engineering new versions of AAV that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Using various molecular strategies, a handful of teams have modified the protein shell that surrounds the virus so it can gain entry and become broadly distributed within the brain. These modified viral vectors are now under development and could begin clinical testing within a few years. Scientists are also tinkering with the inner machinery of AAV to sidestep potential toxicities. With a safe, effective method for accessing the brain, researchers will be able to devise gene therapies for a range of neurological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and devastating rare diseases that lack any treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the tremendous need for rapidly deployable therapies to counteract emerging viruses.

The United States \u2014 unlike several European countries that have funneled millions to the terror group to spare the lives of their citizens \u2014 refused to pay.\nBalboni also told WCVB, that the family received an email last week \u2014 after the U.S. began its bombing campaign against ISIL \u2014 indicating that they were going to kill Foley. That email made no demands and was \"full of rage,\" making no suggestion that he could be spared with a payment.\nOver at Reuters, David Rohde, a reporter who was once held hostage by the Taliban himself, writes about the disparity between the United States and Europe vis-\u00e0-vis their policies on negotiating for hostages, which he says can save \"European hostages but can doom the Americans.\"\nOne clear lesson that has emerged in recent years, however, is that security threats are more effectively countered by united American and European action. The divergent U.S. and European approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims.\nTerrorist groups like ISIL, and al-Qaeda and their affiliates have netted $125 million from kidnapping over the last six years, according to an earlier investigation by The New York Times, with more than half of that coming in the last year alone.\nIn the coming days, we'll likely be hearing more debates about this policy, especially as its perils are held in contrast to those of Europe's \u2014 especially as the world collectively hopes for a better outcome for the three Americans still said to be held by ISIL. One of them is Steven Sotloff, a TIME journalist, whom ISIL says it will kill if the airstrikes continue.\n\nName three ice cream flavors.

For her feature debut, which world premiered in Berlin Film Festival\u2019s Panorama and also screens at Transilvania Film Festival, the Ukraine\u2019s writer-director Marysia Nikitiuk has delivered a genre-blender, a coming-of-age tale laced with a local mob sub-plot, vignettes of misery, in country and city alike and a magic realism. The last reflects the mindset of Vitka, a snub-nosed five-year-old rebel who lives in a benighted village in the Ukrainian sticks. She bears witness to her teen cousin Larysa enjoying a passionately physical affair with a young hoodlum, called Scar. But when Scar is forced to go on the run, and Larysa caves in to her mother\u2019s pressure to do the right thing and marry a young local pig farmer, Vitka has to learn to fend for herself in a hostile environment. To do so, she uses her imagination.\nWhy the genre mix?\nThe story came to me with all its controversial sides naturally. I didn\u2019t construct it as a puzzle with cold heart, but rather it was mostly emotion leaded storytelling. And, at the core of a story, for me, was always little Vitka, it couldn\u2019t be pure social-realism. Vitka\u2019s perception is a key for mixing these genres together naturally. Being in her role as part of a childish magical world she reflects sins of adults like a mirror.\nTaking in the violence of post-Soviet era, \u201cWhen the Trees Fall\u201d also describes the violence in family relations. Larysa\u2019s mother almost slaps Larysa into submission. Her grandmother threatens to beat Vitka when she is naughty. Could you comment?\nWhen I was little I witnessed a lot of violent family relationships, and even experienced some. Getting older I understood that most people in our post-Soviet world live with family traumas and pass them to next generation. Only now people in Ukraine are starting to learn to be good parents in order not to ruin a growing life. I think it comes from our totalitarian past \u2013 the Soviet Union didn\u2019t need to have happy people, but obedient and controllable.\nWhat decisions did you take as a director to knit the different elements of \u201cWhen the Trees Fall\u201d?\nFirst of all, I was working hard with actors with support from experienced theater teacher-director Igor Koltovskoy.

So \u2013 we have to go international to complete financing. But also this gives an opportunity for the film to get artistic input and distribution in co-producing countries.\nDo you feel you are in any way a member of a new generation of Ukrainian filmmakers? If so, what are its hallmarks?\nYou know, we\u2019re now in the process of building Ukrainian filmmaking. All my director friends are obsessed with telling contemporary stories about modern Ukrainians, but we are also so different. It looks like we came not from one tradition, but from traditions of many different films, depending on which ones we liked. I can say the same about Ukraine as a whole. For more than 20 years people in Ukraine wanted to be someone else, and only now we are discovering who we really are.\nFor your company, Igor, what do you see as the way forward? How would you like to continue and grow?\nSavychenko: In the Ukraine it\u2019s very difficult to do films because we have only one film fund where we can get money. It\u2019s nearly impossible to get money from TV or other sources, no pre-sales, no MG; co-production is the only way. Most films I do are debuts with first-time directors. Film schools in Ukraine are archaic, but lots of filmmakers are still open-minded after graduation. I prefer to catch those ones before they go into routine work for television or into commercials where they quite often lose they artistic vision and ambitions.\nYou\u2019ve said the Ukrainian film industry is building. How?\nSavychenko: The Ukrainian State Film Agency started in 2011. Before that there was almost nothing. In 2011, it started giving money and growing its budget. It was a start for Ukrainian filmmaking, a good start. When we first started working on an international level it was extremely difficult so I did five feature films with the support of the State Agency. And something like 30 shorts and documentaries. In the beginning, it was difficult to do co-productions because nobody knew about Ukrainian filmmaking. When got to Berlin or Cannes, we were like people from some far off land. Year-by-year as our films went to big festivals, we started to get recognized. Also locally comedy \u201cDzidzio,\u201d which I did not produce) was one comedy, which was very well received by audiences. They recouped, which was great sign for the whole industry. Another notable film has been \u201cCyborgs: Heroes Never Die\u201d about the current war in Ukraine with pro-Russian separatists.\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0454\u043c\u043e \u0456\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u2019\u044e \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0456 \u041d\u0456\u043a\u0456\u0442\u044e\u043a \u0442\u0430 \u0406\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0456\u0437 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 John Hopewell, Jamie Lang, Variety \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0444\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043c \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u00bb.\nThe director and producer of the Ukrainian Berlinale Panorama entry also discuss their building national film industry.\n\u201cWhen the Trees Fall\u201d describes the gross poverty, ignorance and racism of rural Ukraine and takes in the extraordinary physical ugliness of the nearest city, whose high-rises makes Paris HMLs look like Park Avenue.\nBut the film, brought onto the market by Latido Films, is no ordinary social realist tract. For her feature debut, which world premiered in Berlin Film Festival\u2019s Panorama and also screens at Transilvania Film Festival, the Ukraine\u2019s writer-director Marysia Nikitiuk has delivered a genre-blender, a coming-of-age tale laced with a local mob sub-plot, vignettes of misery, in country and city alike and a magic realism. The last reflects the mindset of Vitka, a snub-nosed five-year-old rebel who lives in a benighted village in the Ukrainian sticks. She bears witness to her teen cousin Larysa enjoying a passionately physical affair with a young hoodlum, called Scar. But when Scar is forced to go on the run, and Larysa caves in to her mother\u2019s pressure to do the right thing and marry a young local pig farmer, Vitka has to learn to fend for herself in a hostile environment. To do so, she uses her imagination.\nWhy the genre mix?\nThe story came to me with all its controversial sides naturally. I didn\u2019t construct it as a puzzle with cold heart, but rather it was mostly emotion leaded storytelling. And, at the core of a story, for me, was always little Vitka, it couldn\u2019t be pure social-realism. Vitka\u2019s perception is a key for mixing these genres together naturally. Being in her role as part of a childish magical world she reflects sins of adults like a mirror.\nTaking in the violence of post-Soviet era, \u201cWhen the Trees Fall\u201d also describes the violence in family relations. Larysa\u2019s mother almost slaps Larysa into submission. Her grandmother threatens to beat Vitka when she is naughty. Could you comment?\nWhen I was little I witnessed a lot of violent family relationships, and even experienced some. Getting older I understood that most people in our post-Soviet world live with family traumas and pass them to next generation. Only now people in Ukraine are starting to learn to be good parents in order not to ruin a growing life. I think it comes from our totalitarian past \u2013 the Soviet Union didn\u2019t need to have happy people, but obedient and controllable.\nWhat decisions did you take as a director to knit the different elements of \u201cWhen the Trees Fall\u201d?\nFirst of all, I was working hard with actors with support from experienced theater teacher-director Igor Koltovskoy. Knowing that the story has at least three different genre elements, I pushed actors to live and exist in one context, so they would be on the same level. Also I tried in the script, and latter with editing, to combine everything with poetic fantasy elements, like the passing and appearance of a white horse.\nThe film was put through multiple workshops or works-in-progress at the Warsaw, Tallinn, Vilnius, Trieste and Odessa festivals.

Queen were known (at least should have been known) by writing the most extravagant hit singles of their time (remember BoRhap, Bicycle Race, Under Pressure?). Innuendo was probably the most unusual hit single (UK No1) of the nineties in terms of form, meter changes, modes and dramatic changes in style (classic rock, operatic choirs, spanish guitar interlude), and its over six minute length is also unusual in context of singles. Of course the chart succes can't be explained directly by the built in musical values nor by catchy melodies. It can be treated as an once-in-a-decade chart anomly (and good promotion - not in the US tough). In 1991 the song was a major surprise even from Queen, the band seemed to have kept the habit pulling out surprising songs even after some twenty years. level of musical framework. have instrumental pre-Verse sections first of which is the Intro. The song starts with snare drumroll (shade of God Save The Queen) and Freddie's slow count-in. I'm going to transcribe the song with double as fast beat as what the count-in suggest. five the arrangement is thickened by rhythm guitars fading in and fading to feedback harmonics. The lead guitar motif in the last measures rhythmically resonates with those in the pre-verse. The Intro I subsection is four measures long (only two according to Freddie's count-in). The \"body\" of the intro consists of two roughly parallel four measure phrases. Intro III consists of two short phrases (2+2 AA). The drum pattern changes from the bolero-esque pattern to a relative straightaway one. Guitar alternate E5 chords and a lead motif (note the subtle change of the later in the second incarnation of this section). The bass plays pumping E-s thorughout. The mode is phrygian with occassional ionian (ie. Major scale) infections (2th and 3th degrees in measure 4 and 8). The melody is not particularly catchy (in the \"popular\" meaning of the word), it oscillates around the 1st degree resonating with the \"spanish\" 8-9-8-7-8 ornament associated with the flamenco style. Note the extensive use of melodic (and rhythmic) variants in the three Verses in each four phrases. The second half of the section paralells the first one a Major third higher. It's mainly a key shift from E to G#. The ionian infection (Bb, C) at the end helps to modulate to the IV key (ie: Db Major). tonic (note its surrogate chord in measure 9 :the subdominant in second inversion). The phrase-long prolonged tonic chord in the last phrase gets no resolution, instead of that the harmony returns to E on the last beat of the section. | V | - ... The sung phrases are completed with guitar motifs, similarly as in say We Are The Champions. The first two phrases are more or less identical with the \"original\" version. Then two extra phrases are added, these are variants of the first two. The third phrase adds cascaded harmonies (see also in \"I'm In Love With My Car\"), and the lead melody is not variant of. The next phrase is chord-wise and lyics-wise more or less identical with the \"original\", the lead melody is subtly varied (you have to listen to both of them next to eachother several times to get the picture), and adds an \"echo\". The rest of the section is doubled up in length compared to the first choruses. Melodically the two inner sub-phrases are the \"extra\" ones the second of which is instrumental (except the vocal pick-upof the next sub-phrase). Lead guitar enters on the downbeat of the second sub-phrase. The Ab-phrygian scale provides a tonic favor to the Ab chord. The descending solo fill with many step-wise ornaments is very May-esque (see also in Bohemian Rhapsody or You Don't Fool Me). The song closes deceptively on A5. The guitar chord (second iversion: A5/E) fades into feedback harmony that distantly resonates with the intro of the song. As the final fermata chord (A5) of the second Chorus fades away starts the interlude with a placid theme dominated by double-phrases. Two acoustic guitars (treble lead + open chord arpeggios). The two phrases are more or less identical. The tonality is not clear here. The pitch set of this sub-section is: A B C# D E F (G) (A aeolean with raised third?). Also the last subsection consists of double phrases (AA'). The second of which adds vocal harmonies mimicking the guitar chords. The tonality is still not clear, so no roman numerals. This instrumental section is characterized by the Am > G > F > E \"spanish\" progression, and odd time signatures. Strangely Queen have never used odd-time signatures (except occassional measures of course, and maybe also BoRhap) except Innuendo. As you can see the second half of the phrases are in 6/8. The 3/4 interpretation would be tad disorienting: try to keep the beat while humming this part without playing the song along! The first phrase adds handclaps from measure 3. The two lead guitars play in octaves until measure 6. In the last two measures Steve Howe plays a full two octave long ascending chromatic scale (24+1 1/16 notes). In the second phrase the guitars go into harmony (parallel thirds most of the times). Measure 11 adds extra lead guitar, the other two lead guitar fade to just backing it in the third phrase. In the third phrase the harmony guitar is dropped, the spanish lead/rhythm motif is subtly modified. The last chord is prolonged one extra measure longer. This spanish section is reprised in a hard-rock style after the operatic section, this time arranged for eletric guitars and drums (and synth). Note Rogers drumming. Similarly to the \"Spanish\" section the first phrase has single tracked lead guitar, the second phrase adds a harmony guitar below that, and the third phrase adds an extra lead guitar backed by the harmony guitars. Both this and the acoustic solo end with a descending figure arriving on a low E note. Note the spanish motif remains harmonized here and aforementioned subtle change is not done here. This section is in 3/4. The first phrase is uneven three measure long. The second phrase roughly parallels it but it's one measure longer. The arch-shaped non-snycopated lead melody in both first and second phrase move exclusively in steps, which is nicely reflected in the synth-orchestration (probably done by Dave Richards). No drums used. Note the chimes-like synth. The first two phrases have single lead vocal, the rest of the section is harmonized. In the third phrase the vocal harmonies alternate the inversion of the same chord (Am). Note the step-wise ascending bass in measures 10-11. The fourth phrase parallel the third, but the harmonies here", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Key: E phrygian, G# phrygian, Db mixolydian(?), a minor, C Major.

In 1991 the song was a major surprise even from Queen, the band seemed to have kept the habit pulling out surprising songs even after some twenty years. level of musical framework. have instrumental pre-Verse sections first of which is the Intro. The song starts with snare drumroll (shade of God Save The Queen) and Freddie's slow count-in. I'm going to transcribe the song with double as fast beat as what the count-in suggest. five the arrangement is thickened by rhythm guitars fading in and fading to feedback harmonics. The lead guitar motif in the last measures rhythmically resonates with those in the pre-verse. The Intro I subsection is four measures long (only two according to Freddie's count-in). The \"body\" of the intro consists of two roughly parallel four measure phrases. Intro III consists of two short phrases (2+2 AA). The drum pattern changes from the bolero-esque pattern to a relative straightaway one. Guitar alternate E5 chords and a lead motif (note the subtle change of the later in the second incarnation of this section). The bass plays pumping E-s thorughout. The mode is phrygian with occassional ionian (ie. Major scale) infections (2th and 3th degrees in measure 4 and 8). The melody is not particularly catchy (in the \"popular\" meaning of the word), it oscillates around the 1st degree resonating with the \"spanish\" 8-9-8-7-8 ornament associated with the flamenco style. Note the extensive use of melodic (and rhythmic) variants in the three Verses in each four phrases. The second half of the section paralells the first one a Major third higher. It's mainly a key shift from E to G#. The ionian infection (Bb, C) at the end helps to modulate to the IV key (ie: Db Major). tonic (note its surrogate chord in measure 9 :the subdominant in second inversion). The phrase-long prolonged tonic chord in the last phrase gets no resolution, instead of that the harmony returns to E on the last beat of the section. | V | - ... The sung phrases are completed with guitar motifs, similarly as in say We Are The Champions. The first two phrases are more or less identical with the \"original\" version. Then two extra phrases are added, these are variants of the first two. The third phrase adds cascaded harmonies (see also in \"I'm In Love With My Car\"), and the lead melody is not variant of. The next phrase is chord-wise and lyics-wise more or less identical with the \"original\", the lead melody is subtly varied (you have to listen to both of them next to eachother several times to get the picture), and adds an \"echo\". The rest of the section is doubled up in length compared to the first choruses. Melodically the two inner sub-phrases are the \"extra\" ones the second of which is instrumental (except the vocal pick-upof the next sub-phrase). Lead guitar enters on the downbeat of the second sub-phrase. The Ab-phrygian scale provides a tonic favor to the Ab chord. The descending solo fill with many step-wise ornaments is very May-esque (see also in Bohemian Rhapsody or You Don't Fool Me). The song closes deceptively on A5. The guitar chord (second iversion: A5/E) fades into feedback harmony that distantly resonates with the intro of the song. As the final fermata chord (A5) of the second Chorus fades away starts the interlude with a placid theme dominated by double-phrases. Two acoustic guitars (treble lead + open chord arpeggios). The two phrases are more or less identical. The tonality is not clear here. The pitch set of this sub-section is: A B C# D E F (G) (A aeolean with raised third?). Also the last subsection consists of double phrases (AA'). The second of which adds vocal harmonies mimicking the guitar chords. The tonality is still not clear, so no roman numerals. This instrumental section is characterized by the Am > G > F > E \"spanish\" progression, and odd time signatures. Strangely Queen have never used odd-time signatures (except occassional measures of course, and maybe also BoRhap) except Innuendo. As you can see the second half of the phrases are in 6/8. The 3/4 interpretation would be tad disorienting: try to keep the beat while humming this part without playing the song along! The first phrase adds handclaps from measure 3. The two lead guitars play in octaves until measure 6. In the last two measures Steve Howe plays a full two octave long ascending chromatic scale (24+1 1/16 notes). In the second phrase the guitars go into harmony (parallel thirds most of the times). Measure 11 adds extra lead guitar, the other two lead guitar fade to just backing it in the third phrase. In the third phrase the harmony guitar is dropped, the spanish lead/rhythm motif is subtly modified. The last chord is prolonged one extra measure longer. This spanish section is reprised in a hard-rock style after the operatic section, this time arranged for eletric guitars and drums (and synth). Note Rogers drumming. Similarly to the \"Spanish\" section the first phrase has single tracked lead guitar, the second phrase adds a harmony guitar below that, and the third phrase adds an extra lead guitar backed by the harmony guitars. Both this and the acoustic solo end with a descending figure arriving on a low E note. Note the spanish motif remains harmonized here and aforementioned subtle change is not done here. This section is in 3/4. The first phrase is uneven three measure long. The second phrase roughly parallels it but it's one measure longer. The arch-shaped non-snycopated lead melody in both first and second phrase move exclusively in steps, which is nicely reflected in the synth-orchestration (probably done by Dave Richards). No drums used. Note the chimes-like synth. The first two phrases have single lead vocal, the rest of the section is harmonized. In the third phrase the vocal harmonies alternate the inversion of the same chord (Am). Note the step-wise ascending bass in measures 10-11. The fourth phrase parallel the third, but the harmonies here\nName three ice cream flavors.

The method is widely used in real estate and project-based investing, as it takes into account the investor's return without the influence of external factors such as inflation or the cost of capital. In the context of savings and loans, the IRR is often referred to as the effective interest rate.\nSaid differently, the internal rate of return is a general indicator of the profitability or overall annualized yield of an investment. While the actual rate of return that any given project ends up generating will often differ from its estimated IRR, a higher IRR is generally the goal.\nThat being said, the risk an investor accepts in trade for a higher rate of return is a big deal.\nAs discussed in our white paper, the average annual return of farmland for the last 25 years has been roughly 11%-12% according to the NCREIF index. Importantly, this has been with relatively little volatility and consistently positive returns: This annual return is the combination of yield plus appreciation in land value. Though calculation of IRR over long time periods can become slightly complex, a decent rule of thumb we use for IRR regarding farmland is simply using this combination of yield and appreciation in land value.\nGiven the combination of annual yield plus annual land value appreciation is a decent proxy for IRR, we use this to illustrate IRR given it is the simplest approximation of what an investor's overall return could be.\nInterestingly, annual yield is often the larger variable. This annual yield, or rent the landowner receives from the farmer, can vary based on commodity prices. While we seek longer-term leases with farmers (typically 3-5 years), over time, the underlying yield should represent expansion in commodity prices. Commodity prices like beans and corn often follow overall inflation. Thus, the attractive inflationary hedge of owning farmland.\nIn today's environment, due to exceptionally good farming weather for several years in a row, looming trade wars, low interest rates, and a myriad of other factors, commodity prices are relatively depressed. Thus, the yield on farmland is pretty low. However, as history has shown us, the upward trend in commodity prices should persist over time, and thus farmland yields may increase as well.\nDespite this potential for increasing commodity prices over the long term, we assume the currently-depressed yields persist for purposes of our IRR calculation.\nOn top of annual yield is the growth in farmland value. As the table below shows, the Cumulative Average Growth Rate (CAGR) of farmland over the last 50 years has been relatively stable, regardless of the time period chosen. For our IRR calculation, we use the longest time period available from the USDA database, 50 years. Over that time period, the average annual value growth in farmland has been 5.4%.\nFor an example of above, if we look at a fairly standard piece of farmland in the Midwest or the South, let's assume an annual yield of 3% and an annual growth in land value of 5.4%. The resulting IRR would be roughly 8.4%.\nWhile this is a simplified view of IRR, and actual outcomes can vary widely versus projections, this gives us an idea of the anticipated IRR.\nIt is worth noting that this IRR was calculated WITHOUT assuming any debt.\nWhile debt can amplify an investment's anticipated returns, it is also a potentially dangerous mechanism, as noted in our post about leverage and debt.\nAdditional Note: The information above is not intended as investment advice.

Seniors can choose from a variety of assisted living services at the Eternal Spring of Gilbert, including typical personal care (like assistance with activities of daily living), housekeeping services, and medication assistance. However, the staff is not equipped to provide a higher level of senior care above personal care and memory care, as the retirement community is not a licensed nursing home. Like other memory care communities and assisted living communities in the area, the Eternal Spring of Gilbert's caregivers are not licensed to provide ongoing health care or nursing care to assisted living residents. They can assist with Alzheimer's care, medication assistance, and help a person with their daily living activities, but long term care providers like nursing homes may be more suitable for seniors with extensive health care needs.\nBefore a person may move into the Eternal Spring of Gilbert, they must speak with one of the senior living community's trained care advisors. A care advisor works one-on-one with current and prospective residents to make sure they receive the care they need. For people with Alzheimer's and dementia, it is particularly important for them to speak with a care advisor who can determine is assisted living services are suitable for their needs, or if they require Alzheimer's care to give them peace of mind.\nOf the assisted living communities and independent living facilities in Maricopa County, few offer the wide variety of elder care services as the Eternal Spring of Gilbert. The community offers many types of long-term care, welcoming people with mobility issues, ongoing health concerns, and Alzheimer's disease.

Jesus has a heart for the world. Let\u2019s talk about it, on Key Life. This is Key Life. We are here to let you know that because of what Jesus has done, God will never be angry at you again. Steve invited our friend Justin Holcomb to do the teaching this week. Justin is an Episcopal priest, an author, and professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. Thank you Matthew. We\u2019re going to do something a little bit different this week and you\u2019re going to love it. As you know, we\u2019ve been studying the book of Acts, well, for the last 18 years. And we\u2019re closing in on the end of that. And we\u2019ve got some things that we want to do. And so, I\u2019ve asked my beloved friend Justin Holcomb, Dr. Justin Holcomb, and he\u2019s written a book on the book of Acts. He\u2019s a scholar, a seminary professor, a Canon in the church, and bunches of other good things. And I\u2019ve known him since he was a kid and he had hair down to his belt. And now he\u2019s a scholar, PhD, brilliant and used in an amazing way, but I knew him when. And so, I\u2019ve invited Justin to spend a week with me and we\u2019re going to look at an overview of the Book of Acts. Now, we\u2019re going to set aside, after this week, we\u2019re going to set aside Acts for a little bit because I\u2019ve recently had a book published. I\u2019m going to keep doing it until I get it right and we\u2019re going to spend a few weeks on the themes of that book, Laughter and Lament. And then at the end of that, assuming everything works the way that we think it\u2019s going to and it never does, we\u2019ll return and wrap up the last two or three chapters of the Book of Acts. Justin, I know how busy you are. Thank you for taking time to come in. Justin Holcomb: Anytime I have the chance to hang out with you, and because you\u2019re my friend, but before you were my friend, you were my seminary professor. So, you\u2019re a voice still in my head, 25 years ago. It was 25 years ago, actually it was 27 years ago, you started being my professor and then graduated 25 years ago. So, it was a long time ago. Oh that is, and it seems like yesterday. Justin Holcomb: So, the chance to do this with you. This is something I would\u2019ve dreamed about as a seminary student, and I\u2019m thrilled to be here with you. And as you may know or may not know, Justin is one of the voices of Key Life, and you\u2019ll be hearing from him quite often. And I want to just set aside the Acts thing and tell stories about you. Justin Holcomb: No. Justin Holcomb: Some of those were confessions too, by the way. Oh. I mean, there\u2019s so many good stories, but we won\u2019t go there because we\u2019re here to discuss God\u2019s word. You love the Book of Acts? Justin Holcomb: I love it. It\u2019s an amazing book in, I\u2019m not pushing books, but I did a Bible study on Acts. It\u2019s called Acts: 12 Week Study. And it\u2019s in a whole series from Crossway where they did a 12 week study on every book of the Bible. And I had to dive in on the deep end of Acts, and for like a year or so and I loved it. Acts is, there\u2019s things in there that I didn\u2019t notice till you kind of dive into it. Same thing you\u2019re noticing as you\u2019re doing this. I\u2019m noticing things as we\u2019ve gone through this series that I hadn\u2019t seen before and they\u2019re amazing. And they are powerful. It\u2019s a great book. And I think probably, and we were discussing off air, some of the things we\u2019re going to be talking about. And we decided to start with God\u2019s passion for the world. You know, God\u2019s people were pretty small, pretty focused, we\u2019re it and nobody else kind of thing. And that happens to evangelicals too. We get the idea that God stops outside the walls of our churches and as soon as they get doctrinally a little bit different, they\u2019re not a part of us. But Acts blasts that to smithereens. Justin Holcomb: It\u2019s impressive. Yeah, it does because the story of Acts is God\u2019s grace and mercy flooding the entire world. In the entire Book of Acts there\u2019s the whole structure of the Book of Acts is actually, comes from Acts 1:8 that.

I mean, it was, so that was shocking that the Holy Spirit, meaning that when the Holy Spirit comes upon them that they\u2019re equals to the Jews who believe in Jesus. And then you have Gentiles in Acts 10 and 11, which is unbelievably shocking, this is not just for the Jews, or it may be the Samaritans, but the Gentiles? And then Acts 19, it\u2019s the followers of John the Baptist. These people didn\u2019t even know everything that Jesus did yet. They were like in a time warp. And so, there\u2019s this beautiful picture of that. Then you have verses like Acts 2:39 that this is from Peter. This is for you and for those that are far off. Justin Holcomb: this message for those who are far off. And then you have two other ones. You have Paul in Acts 13 versus 46 and 47 saying. I want to go where, to the Gentiles. I\u2019m called for the Gentiles. And he\u2019s hearkening back to Isaiah 49:6. This has been God\u2019s plan since the Creation, is that his image, his images and his glory would fill the world. And so, Paul picks up on Isaiah 49:6 and says, I\u2019m going for them. And then the very last verse of Acts says, it has Paul in prison, living in Rome, proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance. Here he is in Rome, like the very last verse is, it\u2019s there, he\u2019s, the gospel\u2019s been proclaimed.

Jesus has a heart for the world. Let\u2019s talk about it, on Key Life. This is Key Life. We are here to let you know that because of what Jesus has done, God will never be angry at you again. Steve invited our friend Justin Holcomb to do the teaching this week. Justin is an Episcopal priest, an author, and professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. Thank you Matthew. We\u2019re going to do something a little bit different this week and you\u2019re going to love it. As you know, we\u2019ve been studying the book of Acts, well, for the last 18 years. And we\u2019re closing in on the end of that. And we\u2019ve got some things that we want to do. And so, I\u2019ve asked my beloved friend Justin Holcomb, Dr. Justin Holcomb, and he\u2019s written a book on the book of Acts. He\u2019s a scholar, a seminary professor, a Canon in the church, and bunches of other good things. And I\u2019ve known him since he was a kid and he had hair down to his belt. And now he\u2019s a scholar, PhD, brilliant and used in an amazing way, but I knew him when. And so, I\u2019ve invited Justin to spend a week with me and we\u2019re going to look at an overview of the Book of Acts. Now, we\u2019re going to set aside, after this week, we\u2019re going to set aside Acts for a little bit because I\u2019ve recently had a book published. I\u2019m going to keep doing it until I get it right and we\u2019re going to spend a few weeks on the themes of that book, Laughter and Lament. And then at the end of that, assuming everything works the way that we think it\u2019s going to and it never does, we\u2019ll return and wrap up the last two or three chapters of the Book of Acts. Justin, I know how busy you are. Thank you for taking time to come in. Justin Holcomb: Anytime I have the chance to hang out with you, and because you\u2019re my friend, but before you were my friend, you were my seminary professor. So, you\u2019re a voice still in my head, 25 years ago. It was 25 years ago, actually it was 27 years ago, you started being my professor and then graduated 25 years ago. So, it was a long time ago. Oh that is, and it seems like yesterday. Justin Holcomb: So, the chance to do this with you. This is something I would\u2019ve dreamed about as a seminary student, and I\u2019m thrilled to be here with you. And as you may know or may not know, Justin is one of the voices of Key Life, and you\u2019ll be hearing from him quite often. And I want to just set aside the Acts thing and tell stories about you. Justin Holcomb: No. Justin Holcomb: Some of those were confessions too, by the way. Oh. I mean, there\u2019s so many good stories, but we won\u2019t go there because we\u2019re here to discuss God\u2019s word. You love the Book of Acts? Justin Holcomb: I love it. It\u2019s an amazing book in, I\u2019m not pushing books, but I did a Bible study on Acts. It\u2019s called Acts: 12 Week Study. And it\u2019s in a whole series from Crossway where they did a 12 week study on every book of the Bible. And I had to dive in on the deep end of Acts, and for like a year or so and I loved it. Acts is, there\u2019s things in there that I didn\u2019t notice till you kind of dive into it. Same thing you\u2019re noticing as you\u2019re doing this. I\u2019m noticing things as we\u2019ve gone through this series that I hadn\u2019t seen before and they\u2019re amazing. And they are powerful. It\u2019s a great book. And I think probably, and we were discussing off air, some of the things we\u2019re going to be talking about. And we decided to start with God\u2019s passion for the world. You know, God\u2019s people were pretty small, pretty focused, we\u2019re it and nobody else kind of thing. And that happens to evangelicals too. We get the idea that God stops outside the walls of our churches and as soon as they get doctrinally a little bit different, they\u2019re not a part of us. But Acts blasts that to smithereens. Justin Holcomb: It\u2019s impressive. Yeah, it does because the story of Acts is God\u2019s grace and mercy flooding the entire world. In the entire Book of Acts there\u2019s the whole structure of the Book of Acts is actually, comes from Acts 1:8 that.

We assessed the relationships between land use, stream-water quality, and the structure of the fish assemblages on a subbasin scale from data obtained in 44 sampling sites. A gradient of change from the rural upper sector to the urbanized and industrialized lower basin in conjunction with water-quality impoverishment was recorded. Redundancy analysis revealed that dissolved oxygen concentration, heavy metals, detergents, and Escherichia coli were the most explanatory variables of that gradient.

Changes in adoption have been manifold too and there are now, for example, many single parent adopters, and even more single special guardian carers, who must on their own, frequently without the support of family, shoulder parental and care responsibilities for some of our most troubled, vulnerable children and young people \u2013 often without recourse to respite. Achieving respite that works for both child and parent/carer brings its own problems for families where a child has Attachment Disorder, and who can be so easily de-stabilised by changes in care (see page 24 of our Interim Report, 6th March 2018) Special Guardians and Adopters Together Interim Report 6th March 2018. It is wrong that in order to access respite we must put our children back into care, under Section 20 Care Orders, when this makes them feel rejected by us. This is a flawed policy and a flawed framework for us \u2013 it might work for others \u2013 but not for us.\nWe seek help in an environment that is percieved and experienced by us as frightening and hostile, where fault is too quickly and too often sought by agencies \u2013 in response to our help seeking. Criticism and blame are much too frequently the outcomes of our seeking support. No one wants to be put in the shame corner when they are under great duress and ask for help and support, but this is what we are asking of Adopters and Special Guardians \u2013 and it is too much to ask. No one should fear the removal of their beloved children in this situation. This will clearly compound stress, not alleviate it.\nParents and guardians are, we discovered, in our survey, which looked at parent and carer stress, too frightened even to seek help from their GP, lest their capacity to parent and care for their children is called into question as a result. 147/389 (nearly 40%) of survey respondents, declared they had been frightened to seek help from their GP about the impact on their mental health of stress arising from their parental or caring role (see page 47 of our Interim Report).\nWhy are they so scared? Are their fears founded?\nSpecial Guardians and Adopters Together believe that parents and carers are not simply deluded and paranoid people. The system is letting us down. It is letting down many people, but here it is letting down people who are trying to parent and care for children who would otherwise be in care.\nAs we see it, the threshold of \u2018Beyond Parental Control\u2019 is one of the most serious problems for our children and families. This is because children who have been traumatised by early life losses, abuse, neglect and possibly multiple changes in primary carer during the seminal developmental stages of life, seek to control those that parent and care for them \u2013 because the loss of control is perceived as a survival threat to them. When our children are younger it can be hard to cope with and exhausting, but as they reach teenage years it becomes impossible, at times, to contain them and look after them safely. If we cannot get the help and support we need at this stage then they are in big trouble.\nReturning our children to the system under Section 20 Care Orders to access respite, or Section 31 Care Orders if the LA takes the case to court, is leading to ruined young lives when the threshold of Beyond Parental Control is proven in contested hearings. Whatever short term benefits are envisaged for our children by learned members of the judiciary, leaving us in the shame corner with a Section 31 Care Order is not going to help us move forwards as a family. Under this Order we are totally unable to utilise our parental knowledge or care experience, because we are viewed by the State as a \u2018risk of serious harm\u2019 to the child we sought to help. This Order means a legal framework that works against us, and our children, who still need parents and families \u2013 even when they cannot safely live with them. Our children are only \u2018Beyond Parental Control\u2019 because this is a legacy of their past, which we are trying to help them recover from.\nTo make matters worse there is a \u2018closing of ranks\u2019 within and between agencies and services once the Section 31 Order has been given, which can extend to charities and organisations that purport to represent the interests of our children and us.\na) There are no models for rehabilitation for our children when they re-enter care. There is no training given to professionals who work with our children about how to achieve this.\nd) There is no accountability when Care Orders are implemented in ways that result in our children coming to serious harm after re-entering care, or having their rights violated. The reality is that Independent Reviewing Officers and Cafcass Guardians do not bring cases back to court (see, for example, Jakes Story). If we bring them back to court they are more likely to try to argue that the decision of the Court was right, which means our children are trapped in the system.\ne) There is clearly no \u2018partnership\u2019 working when one party discredits and blames the other, takes them to court and discredits them further.\nf) Our children will find transitioning to adulthood even harder if relationships with family have not been supported by those with a duty of care \u2013 when they have had to live apart from us, for reasons of safety.\nIn order to make progress Adopters and Special Guardians need to be able to \u2018tell it like it is\u2019. We need to be able to talk about the problems that affect us and get in the way of us being able to help our children without fear, and also talk about them with the DofE and with government.\nThis is why we ask you to sign our petition, and ask you to please share it widely.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Being able to \u2018tell it like it is\u2019 is crucially important for Adoption and Special Guardianship because without properly understanding the impact of policy and legislatory frameworks, one cannot improve the lives of those whom these policies, and frameworks are intended to serve.\nSocial change has been exponential in the years since the legal frameworks surrounding adoption were put in place \u2013 with the Children Act 1989, and Special Guardians were not even \u2018invented\u2019 at this time, with this Order being just 14 years old.

Are their fears founded?\nSpecial Guardians and Adopters Together believe that parents and carers are not simply deluded and paranoid people. The system is letting us down. It is letting down many people, but here it is letting down people who are trying to parent and care for children who would otherwise be in care.\nAs we see it, the threshold of \u2018Beyond Parental Control\u2019 is one of the most serious problems for our children and families. This is because children who have been traumatised by early life losses, abuse, neglect and possibly multiple changes in primary carer during the seminal developmental stages of life, seek to control those that parent and care for them \u2013 because the loss of control is perceived as a survival threat to them. When our children are younger it can be hard to cope with and exhausting, but as they reach teenage years it becomes impossible, at times, to contain them and look after them safely. If we cannot get the help and support we need at this stage then they are in big trouble.\nReturning our children to the system under Section 20 Care Orders to access respite, or Section 31 Care Orders if the LA takes the case to court, is leading to ruined young lives when the threshold of Beyond Parental Control is proven in contested hearings. Whatever short term benefits are envisaged for our children by learned members of the judiciary, leaving us in the shame corner with a Section 31 Care Order is not going to help us move forwards as a family. Under this Order we are totally unable to utilise our parental knowledge or care experience, because we are viewed by the State as a \u2018risk of serious harm\u2019 to the child we sought to help. This Order means a legal framework that works against us, and our children, who still need parents and families \u2013 even when they cannot safely live with them. Our children are only \u2018Beyond Parental Control\u2019 because this is a legacy of their past, which we are trying to help them recover from.\nTo make matters worse there is a \u2018closing of ranks\u2019 within and between agencies and services once the Section 31 Order has been given, which can extend to charities and organisations that purport to represent the interests of our children and us.\na) There are no models for rehabilitation for our children when they re-enter care. There is no training given to professionals who work with our children about how to achieve this.\nd) There is no accountability when Care Orders are implemented in ways that result in our children coming to serious harm after re-entering care, or having their rights violated. The reality is that Independent Reviewing Officers and Cafcass Guardians do not bring cases back to court (see, for example, Jakes Story). If we bring them back to court they are more likely to try to argue that the decision of the Court was right, which means our children are trapped in the system.\ne) There is clearly no \u2018partnership\u2019 working when one party discredits and blames the other, takes them to court and discredits them further.\nf) Our children will find transitioning to adulthood even harder if relationships with family have not been supported by those with a duty of care \u2013 when they have had to live apart from us, for reasons of safety.\nIn order to make progress Adopters and Special Guardians need to be able to \u2018tell it like it is\u2019. We need to be able to talk about the problems that affect us and get in the way of us being able to help our children without fear, and also talk about them with the DofE and with government.\nThis is why we ask you to sign our petition, and ask you to please share it widely.\nName three ice cream flavors.

In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage. This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru. Daniel Alom\u00eda Robles's \"El C\u00f3ndor Pasa\" was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in Lima in 1913. The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), El c\u00f3ndor pasa. The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the Library of Congress, under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts. In 1965, the American musician Paul Simon heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band Los Incas in a performance at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Est parisien in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with Los Incas band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member Jorge Milchberg, who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties. In 1970, the Simon & Garfunkel duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name \"El C\u00f3ndor Pasa (If I Could)\". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon & Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and #6 on the Easy Listening chart, in fall 1970.

She was so proud of her children and grandchildren and loved them all very much. While in a home in her final years she was still able to remain a beacon of trust, love, goodness, and stability for her family and friends. That said she will be greatly missed.\nShe is survived by a brother Floyd Hiatt Junior, her sister Iris Whittaker, and her five children. William Jr (Jan), Darrell \"Condemned\", Kevin, Debra (Torsten) Andersen, and James (Diane); 9 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and 3 great-great grandchildren.\nA visitation will be held Wednesday, June 19, 2019 from 6-8 p.m., at Peel Funeral Home, 8525 W 2700 S. Graveside services will be held Friday, June 21, 2019 2:00 p.m. at Pleasant Green Cemetery , 9200 W 3500 S.

Lee McKenzie, Rachel Pattison, Elizabeth Seckman, Stephanie Faris, Lori L MacLaughlin, and Elsie Amata! This month's IWSG question: How do you find the time to write in your busy day? I'm very lucky. When my husband and I decided to have a child, we agreed one of us should stay home with him. Childcare is expensive, after all, and my husband was making enough to support us. Now that our son is in school, we can still pay our bills with me at home. During the school year, I have the weekdays to write. I love it. It makes for a very happy mama. I treat it like a full-time job. Some days, I feel there aren't enough hours to get all my work done, but I am my own worst boss! In the summer and on breaks, I don't get much time to write. On good nights, we can get our son in bed at a decent hour, and there's nothing on television to distract me. Then I write or promote a little more. I don't like staying on the computer late. I've been very good at settling into bed at a reasonable hour and getting a proper sleep. I read a little before going to sleep too. A good sleep also makes for a productive next day. One of my ongoing insecurities is time. While it might seem like I have tons of time to write and promote, sometimes it doesn't feel that way. Real life cuts in. Like a virus sticking around for over a month. (And it gave me pink eye so I can't stare at the screen for very long!) I don't know if I'll ever feel like there's enough time to do what I want, and that's something I'll hopefully learn to accept and not be so harsh on myself about. Is time a concern of yours too? Time is a concern of mine. I never feel as though there's enough, but I am quite terrible at time management, so I know the fault is generally mine. Still feel a lot of pressure, though, that I'm not accomplishing enough. Or anything at all, some days. My goal is to one day be half as productive as you are. You rock! Hope you're feeling better soon! Great post, Christine. I think 'time' should be banned. We'd all be so much happier :) Just wanted to say that you inspire me and I visit your blog whenever I need to be motivated. So, thank you!!! Have a super September! I believe everyone suffers from the Time syndrome!! I also was a stay at home mom for 5 children. I think it's a blessing to be able to raise your own child without daycare. Now that they're grown I can write. but then come the grand babies, and I'm again watching children... Sounds like you're balancing them out pretty good but writing more during the school year when you have the time. It's hard to find the time. I used to write more at night after the kids were in bed, but now I find that watching them go to bed makes me sleepy too. So I don't stay up much any more. The more time I have, the more time I can waste. But, buckling down, treating writing like a career helps in the long run. Hubs & I made the same decision (regarding kids & staying at home). Best wishes. It's great that your husband is supportive and can support the family so you can stay home to take care of your child. Weekend writing is the best! It seems with all I do that the weekend is the one time I can write as well. Typically when we're the busiest, we accomplish the most. Taking care of children is more than just time consuming. It's energy consuming. It's emotionally consuming. We need all three of those things to write and there's only so much in the day. It's great that you have all that time now that your little guy is in school. Real life does interfere no matter what. Prying myself away from the computer is difficult. I can spend all day there. Great post. I like your plan and it looks like it works too. WTG! You're very fortunate on two fronts, Christine. To have had all that time with your son and now to have the time to write. Of course, I hear what you say about life cutting in. That's always part of any deal, isn't it? I do agree. It's taught me to prioritize and think about long term impact to determine what comes first. It's not always what I would choose in a juggling moment but it helps. I wish you much health and happiness with your family and writing. Pesky real life! Rest is important, though. I know I don't get much done if I didn't get much sleep the night before. Sometimes you have to do what you can and be content with that. Time is always a concern for me. That and energy. If I have time, I might not have the energy. Thanks to everyone for stopping in today. Seems time is a big concern for all of us. If only we could write stories in our sleep! I remember when I had little ones, I couldn't write until they were in bed. But then it was my time. I still enjoy writing in the quiet hours of the night. I find the darkness comforting and inspiring. Life does it's thing, which seldom matches my time line, but it is what it is. I feel blessed, especially to know so many talented folks. Your body was telling you to slow down, you didn't listen and it reacted with an illness. I hope you're feeling much better. But as a writer you are one of the top most talented people I know. Don't stress, you have this! You seem to find the perfect balance between writing and other life commitments. It is so awesome that you have support to do two amazingly creative things - write and raise your child. \"Not enough hours in the day\" is always a plague for those of us trying to do more than one thing at a time. You seem to have a good sense with setting priorities. Working at home in any capacity can be hard. Because there's always that laundry pile staring at you or the dishes in the sink.

You can read part one here. Our mission to circumnavigate the UK in my 27ft Rhea 850 is on track and much to my personal relief we have made it round the feared north coast of Scotland to the relatively safe haven of Kinlochbervie. The weather rarely stays settled for long this far north and sure enough it looks like we won\u2019t be leaving Kinlochbervie any time soon. The forecast is pretty grim for the next few days but we\u2019re both grateful we didn\u2019t get trapped in Loch Eriboll, the only bolthole for a boat between Scrabster and Cape Wrath. Here at least we have the bare essentials of western civilisation \u2013 electricity, water, a shop and most importantly of all, a pub. The other good news is that the harbour office has a special BOGOF offer (buy one get one free). I book for two nights just in case with the next two nights gratis, but it gets even better \u2013 the free nights are transferable to the next stop down the track, Lochinver, which unsurprisingly is in Loch Inver. The Highlands Council owns pontoons in various locations along the coast and offers this deal to encourage visitors to stay a few days and make the most of the local facilities. On our third and last night in Kinlochbervie, we eat on board but are told by the bar staff to come up to the pub anyway as The Trooters are playing. The Trooters are a Scottish c\u00e8ilidh band consisting of a fiddle player, pianist and guitarist and as promised they are brilliant. Their name derives from their love of trout fishing or \u2018troots\u2019 as they call them up here. If their casting is as good as their playing, the poor fish don\u2019t stand a chance. The following morning we fill up with diesel (the cheapest yet) at high tide to avoid another long climb up a rusty quayside ladder similar to the one in Scrabster. The chandlery staff are very friendly and manage to dispense the fuel through the huge hose designed for North Sea trawlers without swamping the decks with diesel. We set off with a moderate wind on the nose and a slight sea state to cover the 25 miles to Lochinver. As it\u2019s only a short distance we motor along at a slow displacement speed of 8/9 knots safe in the knowledge it will take us no more than three hours. Everything goes to plan and other than another lively discussion on how much clearance we should allow round another significant Scottish headland we arrive in Lochinver and take possession of a northern-facing finger pontoon as instructed by the harbour master. After our enforced three- night stay in Kinlochbervie, we have the luxury of several different restaurants and pubs to choose from, not to mention a much-needed fresh outlook. As with most ports this far north its main industry is fishing but we can\u2019t help but notice that all the large articulated lorries waiting for the trawlers to land their catches are from Spain and France. We are told that at least 80% of the catch is destined for these two countries alone. Our next planned port of call is the Kyle of Loch Alsh, on the south side of the bridge linking the mainland to the Isle of Skye. There are seasonal pontoons here and a place to eat. It is also a good place to pause and plan our passage through Kyle Rhea, a spectacularly picturesque but tricky \u2018S\u2019 bend a few miles long and only half-a-mile wide with fast tides running through it. We don\u2019t want to be trying to thread our way through this in a wind-against-tide situation. Going through Rhea, however, means avoiding a much longer more exposed route around the west side of Skye with the potential for even more unpleasant sea conditions. It\u2019s a 65-mile run from Lochinver to Loch Alsh and the first 35 miles are into the wind but the sea state is mostly slight other than a couple of lumpier stretches around the headlands. After 35 miles we turn to port past Gairloch, where a neighbouring boat in Lochinver told us that the sea state would reduce noticeably as we came into the shelter of the Isle of Skye. His prediction is correct and we raise our speed to 20 knots as we cruise down the east side of Rona for the last 20 miles to Loch Alsh. Nigel phones ahead to let them know of our imminent arrival. The berthing master answers our call but not from his office. He\u2019s in his car en route to Stirling. Not only is he not around to welcome us in but nor are the pontoons! The weather has been so bad until now (mid-June) that they haven\u2019t had a chance to put them out yet. We\u2019ll either have to pick up one of the three visitors\u2019 mooring buoys, if available, find a berth in Kyleakin (unlikely) or anchor somewhere. He wishes us good luck and signs off. Inevitably, the mooring buoys are occupied and when we try to raft up alongside a sailing boat in Kyleakin, the owner emerges from below decks to let us know we can\u2019t stay there as the local fishing boats have priority. We head back out into Loch Alsh while checking the tide times to see if it is safe to go through Kyle Rhea and onto Mallaig some 15 miles distant, a proper town with a proper marina. It is half tide(ish) with a light wind in the right direction, so off we go. Like the Pentland Firth, there is much written about this short stretch of sea. With the potential for 8-knot tides and katabatic winds, the sailing brigade might find themselves going backwards or round and round in circles in the whirlpools! We enter the beautiful Rhea and see nothing to worry about; the sea is flat with just a few ripples showing where the tide race is meant to be. Start Me Up does lose 5 knots of speed over ground where the tide is at its peak but after a few minutes we are through it and on our way to Mallaig. Forty-five minutes later we are entering Mallaig harbour where a young lady points us in the direction of our very fine berth for the night. Mallaig town is 300 yards away with several pubs and restaurants to choose from and the marina has excellent facilities for yachties and motorboaters alike.

You can read part one here. Our mission to circumnavigate the UK in my 27ft Rhea 850 is on track and much to my personal relief we have made it round the feared north coast of Scotland to the relatively safe haven of Kinlochbervie. The weather rarely stays settled for long this far north and sure enough it looks like we won\u2019t be leaving Kinlochbervie any time soon. The forecast is pretty grim for the next few days but we\u2019re both grateful we didn\u2019t get trapped in Loch Eriboll, the only bolthole for a boat between Scrabster and Cape Wrath. Here at least we have the bare essentials of western civilisation \u2013 electricity, water, a shop and most importantly of all, a pub. The other good news is that the harbour office has a special BOGOF offer (buy one get one free). I book for two nights just in case with the next two nights gratis, but it gets even better \u2013 the free nights are transferable to the next stop down the track, Lochinver, which unsurprisingly is in Loch Inver. The Highlands Council owns pontoons in various locations along the coast and offers this deal to encourage visitors to stay a few days and make the most of the local facilities. On our third and last night in Kinlochbervie, we eat on board but are told by the bar staff to come up to the pub anyway as The Trooters are playing. The Trooters are a Scottish c\u00e8ilidh band consisting of a fiddle player, pianist and guitarist and as promised they are brilliant. Their name derives from their love of trout fishing or \u2018troots\u2019 as they call them up here. If their casting is as good as their playing, the poor fish don\u2019t stand a chance. The following morning we fill up with diesel (the cheapest yet) at high tide to avoid another long climb up a rusty quayside ladder similar to the one in Scrabster. The chandlery staff are very friendly and manage to dispense the fuel through the huge hose designed for North Sea trawlers without swamping the decks with diesel. We set off with a moderate wind on the nose and a slight sea state to cover the 25 miles to Lochinver. As it\u2019s only a short distance we motor along at a slow displacement speed of 8/9 knots safe in the knowledge it will take us no more than three hours. Everything goes to plan and other than another lively discussion on how much clearance we should allow round another significant Scottish headland we arrive in Lochinver and take possession of a northern-facing finger pontoon as instructed by the harbour master. After our enforced three- night stay in Kinlochbervie, we have the luxury of several different restaurants and pubs to choose from, not to mention a much-needed fresh outlook. As with most ports this far north its main industry is fishing but we can\u2019t help but notice that all the large articulated lorries waiting for the trawlers to land their catches are from Spain and France. We are told that at least 80% of the catch is destined for these two countries alone. Our next planned port of call is the Kyle of Loch Alsh, on the south side of the bridge linking the mainland to the Isle of Skye. There are seasonal pontoons here and a place to eat. It is also a good place to pause and plan our passage through Kyle Rhea, a spectacularly picturesque but tricky \u2018S\u2019 bend a few miles long and only half-a-mile wide with fast tides running through it. We don\u2019t want to be trying to thread our way through this in a wind-against-tide situation. Going through Rhea, however, means avoiding a much longer more exposed route around the west side of Skye with the potential for even more unpleasant sea conditions. It\u2019s a 65-mile run from Lochinver to Loch Alsh and the first 35 miles are into the wind but the sea state is mostly slight other than a couple of lumpier stretches around the headlands. After 35 miles we turn to port past Gairloch, where a neighbouring boat in Lochinver told us that the sea state would reduce noticeably as we came into the shelter of the Isle of Skye. His prediction is correct and we raise our speed to 20 knots as we cruise down the east side of Rona for the last 20 miles to Loch Alsh. Nigel phones ahead to let them know of our imminent arrival. The berthing master answers our call but not from his office. He\u2019s in his car en route to Stirling. Not only is he not around to welcome us in but nor are the pontoons! The weather has been so bad until now (mid-June) that they haven\u2019t had a chance to put them out yet. We\u2019ll either have to pick up one of the three visitors\u2019 mooring buoys, if available, find a berth in Kyleakin (unlikely) or anchor somewhere. He wishes us good luck and signs off. Inevitably, the mooring buoys are occupied and when we try to raft up alongside a sailing boat in Kyleakin, the owner emerges from below decks to let us know we can\u2019t stay there as the local fishing boats have priority. We head back out into Loch Alsh while checking the tide times to see if it is safe to go through Kyle Rhea and onto Mallaig some 15 miles distant, a proper town with a proper marina. It is half tide(ish) with a light wind in the right direction, so off we go. Like the Pentland Firth, there is much written about this short stretch of sea. With the potential for 8-knot tides and katabatic winds, the sailing brigade might find themselves going backwards or round and round in circles in the whirlpools! We enter the beautiful Rhea and see nothing to worry about; the sea is flat with just a few ripples showing where the tide race is meant to be. Start Me Up does lose 5 knots of speed over ground where the tide is at its peak but after a few minutes we are through it and on our way to Mallaig.

The more people know about how their actions can affect the environment around them the better off we all will be.\nIs e waste recycling business profitable?\nOf course yes. E-waste recycling is a booming business. This is because there are many people who want the best for the environment and want to recycle their old electronics.

It\u2019s important to research what buyers in your area will buy before you list your items.\nWhat happens to the e-waste that you can\u2019t repair?\nWaste management is a huge problem for many countries. The amount of e-waste that is being thrown out and not being repaired is only going to increase due to the more advanced technology we create. This is a blessing in disguise for you.\nWe all know most the electronics that we use every day have gold in them. There are simple chemical ways to recycle that gold and many other valuable metals like copper, silver, palladium etc.. One tonne of e-waste contains approximately 200 grams of gold which is more than what you can get from an actual gold mine these days.\nThis section discusses some of the top requirements for your e waste recycling plant. Businesses with e-waste recycling plants are permitted to operate in the city areas if they meet certain requirements.\nThe permit process for your e waste recycling plant will depend on the zoning where the facility is located.\nYou may be required to apply for a permit from your local municipal zoning board before you can begin construction on your plant.\nThere are other things like business license, tax ID for your business, operation licenses, building permits, safety permits from the concerned departments etc.. Make sure you follow all the rules and regulations while you are disposing the byproducts after recycling.\nWhy You Should Start an E-Waste Recycling Business?\nThe electronic waste recycling industry is getting popular and profitable. This is because of the growing e-waste generation. You can start an e-waste recycling business with a small capital and turn it into a profitable venture.\nYou can reuse or recycle all kinds of electronics. Even if you are not able to reuse the electronics, you can still recycle them for some money from recyclers who will pay for your scrap metals. One of the main benefits of starting an e-waste recycling business is that you can make a profit from something that would otherwise be treated as garbage or landfilled, which saves a lot of natural resources and reduces environmental pollution.\nThere is a huge market of e-waste in the world. The amount of e-waste produced every year has been growing exponentially, reaching at least 50 million tons in 2013. Many people may not know that there are high return on investment in the recycling business.\nThe market is in need of efficient and sustainable waste solutions and the e-waste recycling business provides the solution. People are comfortable with buying goods at a lower cost because they know their money will be going to a good cause and something that supports the environment.\nE waste recycling business is a high competition industry. But not many people would look at it as a cash cow. There are several businesses that offer the service of recycling electronics, but there is still high demand. This industry can be lucrative because consumers will buy refurbished products and also because the prices of electronic goods are not going down anytime soon.\nIn conclusion, starting an electronics waste business is a great way to do your part in the world and make money at the same time.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the different skills and activities that can foster effective group communication.\nWhat is Effective Group Communication?\nBefore we talk about the different skills and activities that can be used to foster an environment where groups of all sizes communicate well, let's first talk about some terms we will use in this lesson. Group communication can be defined as more than three - but less than 20 - people having a conversation. It differs from a dyad conversation , which is when two people have a face-to-face conversation with one another. We won't spend any time discussing a dyad conversation in this lesson, but it's always good to cover the basics.\nOk, so, we've all been there. You're assigned to a group or team, and required to communicate and work together to reach a desired outcome. Working in groups can be a nightmare if effective communication isn't exercised. There always seems to be one or two people that take on the majority of the work, while the other team members contribute the bare minimum. A lot of companies recognize these issues and work with their Human Resources department to train employees to work more collaboratively.\nEffective group communication can occur in many forms, but you will see the best results (especially in large groups) when there is a leader or facilitator running the conversation. It's not necessary, but it does make things a lot less chaotic. Group members will benefit and participate more if they feel included in the conversation and there is a general respect among the conversation participants.\nSome crucial things to watch for when observing a group conversation are both verbal and nonverbal cues. Nonverbal cues are the most important to look for because they're silent representations of how people are feeling or perceiving a message.\nOther cues to look for also include written and interpersonal skills, or the basic life skills you use every day to communicate with people. Effective group communication isn't always just about talking.\nAnother aspect to consider is how the group is organized during a discussion. Seating can play an important role in creating an environment where people feel safe to share their thoughts. Organizing a group in a circle formation is the optimum structure to get the best interactions.\nThe ideal group environment doesn't just happen overnight. To have a positive atmosphere where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and working together takes work, and only after trust is gained and cooperation is learned can an organization benefit from groups working together. Thus, trust is something that is necessary for people to work productively. Lack of trust can drive a wedge between employees and create an environment of hostility. Trust is often based on respect and being able to rely on a coworker.\nAssign each person a partner and have the group form a large circle.\nIn each set of pairs, blindfold one person.\nPlace miscellaneous items within different areas of the circle. You can also add roadblocks, such as a chair or table, that the blindfolded person will have to navigate around.\nHave the person who is blindfolded follow directions from his/her partner to locate the items within the circle.\nHave the pairs switch roles. Replace the items and repeat the exercise.\nCome together as a whole and discuss what types of communication issues were recognized and how it felt to be in each role.\nCooperation is another key element to effective group communication that goes hand in hand with trust. Being able to cooperate requires employees to be able to resolve conflicts among themselves. It also requires them to express themselves so that coworkers can listen to what they have to say and be able to understand their needs and/or wants. If you cannot express yourself, how can you expect to be heard by the group and effectively communicate?\nThese skills can be difficult to learn as adults as they are often basic skills that are a product of someone's earlier experiences. One way to teach these skills is to have a group workshop on conflict management where you also work on self-expression and confidence. In the workshop, utilize both large and small discussions in groups, along with giving employees the opportunity to practice these skills in role plays, which will help personalize the topics.\nIn addition to collaborating, brainstorming, problem-solving, and debate are all additional ways to further develop communication in a group setting. These are all great ways to put a team to work on a common goal. Whether it's in a real environment solving a business problem or in a workshop with a case study, all of these tools will help bring your team together in a way that will benefit them and the business.\nWhen your employees can trust each other and cooperate, effective communication is a natural result. Effective group communication is based on mutual respect and understanding between peers. It will come about if you encourage an environment where people are aware of their communication style, and where you continually work with them to develop better communication skills. Applying these skills not just to group communication, but to everyday communication as well, can improve people's relationships with family and friends in addition to coworkers and management.\nVisit the Effective Cross-Cultural Communication in Business page to learn more.\nCh 2.

It differs from a dyad conversation , which is when two people have a face-to-face conversation with one another. We won't spend any time discussing a dyad conversation in this lesson, but it's always good to cover the basics.\nOk, so, we've all been there. You're assigned to a group or team, and required to communicate and work together to reach a desired outcome. Working in groups can be a nightmare if effective communication isn't exercised. There always seems to be one or two people that take on the majority of the work, while the other team members contribute the bare minimum. A lot of companies recognize these issues and work with their Human Resources department to train employees to work more collaboratively.\nEffective group communication can occur in many forms, but you will see the best results (especially in large groups) when there is a leader or facilitator running the conversation. It's not necessary, but it does make things a lot less chaotic. Group members will benefit and participate more if they feel included in the conversation and there is a general respect among the conversation participants.\nSome crucial things to watch for when observing a group conversation are both verbal and nonverbal cues. Nonverbal cues are the most important to look for because they're silent representations of how people are feeling or perceiving a message.\nOther cues to look for also include written and interpersonal skills, or the basic life skills you use every day to communicate with people. Effective group communication isn't always just about talking.\nAnother aspect to consider is how the group is organized during a discussion. Seating can play an important role in creating an environment where people feel safe to share their thoughts. Organizing a group in a circle formation is the optimum structure to get the best interactions.\nThe ideal group environment doesn't just happen overnight. To have a positive atmosphere where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and working together takes work, and only after trust is gained and cooperation is learned can an organization benefit from groups working together. Thus, trust is something that is necessary for people to work productively. Lack of trust can drive a wedge between employees and create an environment of hostility. Trust is often based on respect and being able to rely on a coworker.\nAssign each person a partner and have the group form a large circle.\nIn each set of pairs, blindfold one person.\nPlace miscellaneous items within different areas of the circle. You can also add roadblocks, such as a chair or table, that the blindfolded person will have to navigate around.\nHave the person who is blindfolded follow directions from his/her partner to locate the items within the circle.\nHave the pairs switch roles. Replace the items and repeat the exercise.\nCome together as a whole and discuss what types of communication issues were recognized and how it felt to be in each role.\nCooperation is another key element to effective group communication that goes hand in hand with trust. Being able to cooperate requires employees to be able to resolve conflicts among themselves. It also requires them to express themselves so that coworkers can listen to what they have to say and be able to understand their needs and/or wants. If you cannot express yourself, how can you expect to be heard by the group and effectively communicate?\nThese skills can be difficult to learn as adults as they are often basic skills that are a product of someone's earlier experiences. One way to teach these skills is to have a group workshop on conflict management where you also work on self-expression and confidence. In the workshop, utilize both large and small discussions in groups, along with giving employees the opportunity to practice these skills in role plays, which will help personalize the topics.\nIn addition to collaborating, brainstorming, problem-solving, and debate are all additional ways to further develop communication in a group setting. These are all great ways to put a team to work on a common goal. Whether it's in a real environment solving a business problem or in a workshop with a case study, all of these tools will help bring your team together in a way that will benefit them and the business.\nWhen your employees can trust each other and cooperate, effective communication is a natural result. Effective group communication is based on mutual respect and understanding between peers. It will come about if you encourage an environment where people are aware of their communication style, and where you continually work with them to develop better communication skills. Applying these skills not just to group communication, but to everyday communication as well, can improve people's relationships with family and friends in addition to coworkers and management.\nVisit the Effective Cross-Cultural Communication in Business page to learn more.\nCh 2.

Shoppers have options when shopping for the lowest priced Audi A3 Sportback e-tron insurance. They can either spend hours struggling with agents getting price quotes or leverage the internet to get rate quotes. There is a right way and a wrong way to compare insurance rates and we\u2019ll show you the best way to quote coverages for a Audi and get the lowest price. Finding more affordable 2018 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron auto insurance prices is not a difficult process. You just need to invest a few minutes comparing rate quotes from some recommended companies. Price comparisons can be done in several different ways. One of the simplest ways to get the best comparison quotes is a comparison rater form click to view form in new window. This type of form eliminates the need for repetitive form entry for each price estimate. One quote request will get you rate comparisons from auto insurance companies with the best prices. It\u2019s definitely the quickest method. A less efficient way to obtain and compare quotes online consists of going to the website for each individual company and fill out their own quote form. For example, let\u2019s assume you want to view quotes from GEICO, Safeco and Travelers. You would have to visit each site to input your insurance information, which is not fast way to get rate quotes. It doesn\u2019t matter which method you choose, just be sure to compare identical information on every price quote you get. If you have different values for each quote it\u2019s not possible to truly determine the lowest rate. Auto insurance companies do not advertise every policy discount in an easy-to-find place, so here is a list both the well known and also the more inconspicuous ways to save on insurance coverage. Low Miles Discount \u2013 Low mileage vehicles can earn substantially lower rates. Discount for Life Insurance \u2013 Select insurance carriers reward you with better prices if you take out life insurance. Paperwork-free \u2013 Many larger companies will give you a small discount for completing your application over the internet. Early Renewal Discounts \u2013 A few insurance coverage companies offer discounts for renewing your policy prior to your current policy expiration. The savings is around 10%. Anti-theft System \u2013 Vehicles that have factory alarm systems and tracking devices have a lower chance of being stolen and earn discounts up to 10% off your insurance coverage quote. You should keep in mind that most discounts do not apply to the entire cost. Most cut the cost of specific coverages such as collision or personal injury protection. Even though the math looks like it\u2019s possible to get free car insurance, it doesn\u2019t quite work that way. A few popular companies and a partial list of their discounts are detailed below. State Farm offers discounts including anti-theft, safe vehicle, multiple policy, passive restraint, and Steer Clear safe driver discount. GEICO may have discounts that include driver training, defensive driver, federal employee, membership and employees, and emergency military deployment. Liberty Mutual has savings for exclusive group savings, multi-car, preferred payment discount, hybrid vehicle, new vehicle discount, multi-policy, and new graduate. The Hartford offers premium reductions for good student, defensive driver, air bag, driver training, and bundle. Progressive discounts include online signing, continuous coverage, good student, multi-policy, online quote discount, multi-vehicle, and homeowner. When getting a coverage quote, ask all the companies the best way to save money. Some discounts might not be available to policyholders in your area. For a list of companies that offer many of these discounts, click here. When choosing proper insurance coverage for your personal vehicles, there really is not a single plan that fits everyone. Each situation is unique. If you don\u2019t know the answers to these questions but you know they apply to you, then you may want to think about talking to a licensed agent. To find an agent in your area, simply complete this short form. It\u2019s fast, free and can help protect your family. Learning about specific coverages of a insurance policy helps when choosing the right coverages at the best deductibles and correct limits. The terms used in a policy can be confusing and coverage can change by endorsement. This protects you and your vehicle\u2019s occupants from other motorists when they are uninsured or don\u2019t have enough coverage. This coverage pays for hospital bills for your injuries and damage to your Audi A3 Sportback e-tron. Liability coverage will cover injuries or damage you cause to other\u2019s property or people by causing an accident. It protects YOU against claims from other people. It does not cover damage to your own property or vehicle. Split limit liability has three limits of coverage: bodily injury per person, bodily injury per accident and property damage. Your policy might show values of 50/100/50 that means you have a $50,000 limit per person for injuries, a total of $100,000 of bodily injury coverage per accident, and a total limit of $50,000 for damage to vehicles and property. Liability coverage pays for things such as legal defense fees, repair bills for other people\u2019s vehicles, emergency aid, bail bonds and funeral expenses. How much coverage you buy is up to you, but you should buy as high a limit as you can afford. Comprehensive coverage pays for claims like damage from a tornado or hurricane, rock chips in glass and hail damage. The maximum payout a insurance company will pay at claim time is the cash value of the vehicle, so if the vehicle\u2019s value is low it\u2019s not worth carrying full coverage. Collision coverage covers damage to your A3 Sportback e-tron from colliding with another vehicle or an object, but not an animal. You will need to pay your deductible and then insurance will cover the remainder. Collision insurance covers things like scraping a guard rail, crashing into a building, crashing into a ditch, sideswiping another vehicle and damaging your car on a curb. This coverage can be expensive, so consider dropping it from vehicles that are 8 years or older. Drivers also have the option to raise the deductible to get cheaper collision coverage. We covered some good ideas how you can lower your 2018 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron insurance prices. The most important thing to understand is the more rate quotes you have, the higher the chance of saving money. You may even discover the most savings is with the least-expected company.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) \u2014 that Papadopoulos never met the president.\nThis is the story of their year-long romance, which has risen and fallen along with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. They were brought together through the serendipity of a mutual connection \u2014 a man who now plays a central role in Papadopoulos\u2019s guilty plea. The couple\u2019s wedding is on hold as Papadopoulos awaits sentencing.\nPerhaps it is the perfect love story for these complicated times.\nThere is no law of attraction, no prescription for the right way to meet your one and only, and Mangiante and Papadopoulos\u2019s relationship just happened to hinge on a man listed in a sworn affidavit as a potential Russian cutout.\nLove is a crazy thing.\nThe couple, then two strangers, first connected over the social networking site LinkedIn after Papadopoulos noticed that they shared a mutual connection, Joseph Mifsud, a mysterious former Maltese government official who ran an institute called the London Centre of International Law Practice in Britain.\nIs there more than meets the eye with the professor at the center of the Trump-Russia probe? Or less?\nMangiante, 34, had started working at the organization after meeting Mifsud while she was employed at the European Parliament in Brussels. Papadopoulos, 30, who had worked for Mifsud\u2019s organization as well, reached out to say he liked her profile picture.\nBut the two continued to talk over the Internet, before meeting in person for the first time in New York in spring 2017. They hit it off and quickly fell in love, she has said. They spent the summer traveling around Europe; Mykonos and Athens in Greece, and Capri, Italy, according to Business Insider. Life was good.\nTheir troubles began just moments after Papadopoulos had set foot back in the United States on July 27, 2017. Moments after Papadopoulos landed at Washington\u2019s Dulles Airport, he was arrested by federal agents and spent about a day in custody.\nHe was cooperating with investigators by the time he was released, Business Insider reported. Mangiante was still in Europe. And she says she didn\u2019t hear from him for five days after the text, until Aug. 1, when a family member reached out to her to explain what had happened.\nWhen she flew to Chicago to meet with Papadopoulos, she was served a subpoena for the special counsel\u2019s investigation. During her interview with Mueller\u2019s team, she was asked extensively about her stint working for Mifsud.\n\u201cWe went from paradise to hell,\u201d she told The Washington Post\u2019s Rosalind S. Helderman last month.\nStill, they stuck together, with Mangiante spending time in the United States with Papadopoulos, who could no longer travel. And one morning he woke up with a question for her, she said in an interview this week.\n\u201cIn the most simple way you can imagine, he woke up in the morning and asked me if I wanted to marry him,\u201d Mangiante said. She said yes.\nMangiante moved to Chicago recently to live full-time with Papadopoulos she said in the phone interview, which she did from a local Starbucks. Trained as a lawyer, she travels back to Europe regularly to work on a film.\nOnline, she had given a cryptic response about her decision to retread her previous interviews defending her fiancee\u2019s importance in the Trump campaign. But in the interview she was more forthcoming, saying she was provoked by Nunes\u2019s comments.\nNunes, who has been leading the charge to discredit the Mueller investigation, falsely asserted to Fox News that Papadopoulos \u201cnever even knew who Trump \u2014 never even had met with the president,\u201d a claim contradicted by a photograph Trump himself posted in March 2016 that showed Papadopoulos around a table with the then-candidate, Jeff Sessions and other high-level campaign officials at a national security meeting.\nThe couple have a studio apartment together and are awaiting Papadopoulos\u2019s sentencing before they schedule their wedding, in Italy, Mangiante said. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are recommending between zero and six months of jail time for Papadopoulos, provided he continues to cooperate, well short of the five-year sentence he could face.\nMeanwhile, Mifsud is at the center of Papadopoulos\u2019s case in the Russia investigation, as outlined by the special counsel. Referred to in court documents as \u201cthe professor,\u201d it is Mifsud and the statements federal authorities said he made to Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails,\u201d which helped land Papadopoulos in hot water.\nHe is one of the purported Russia-linked contacts that Papadopoulos first told investigators had occurred before the campaign, when in fact they occurred during the campaign, according to court documents in the case.\nMangiante didn\u2019t hesitate when asked this week if she thought there was any irony to the fact that the connection with Mifsud had helped her find her future husband.\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Simona Mangiante, the fiancee of former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, describes the moment she decided to speak out on behalf of her partner.\nWith those few words, Mangiante decided to stop turning down the interview requests that had been pouring in for weeks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the moment that changed my mind,\u201d she said in an interview with The Washington Post this week.\nFrom the role of a silent and mostly unknown partner, Mangiante has since emerged as one of Papadopoulos\u2019s most vocal defenders, carrying out a lonely campaign to push back on attempts by the president and his allies to minimize her fiance\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s campaign.\nMangiante describes her high-profile effort to set the record straight on media outlets like ABC, CNN, the Guardian, and The Washington Post as mostly accidental.\nThis week, Mangiante was back at it again, retweeting months-old interviews she had done in the past that rebutted the notion \u2014 this time falsely pushed by Rep.

The farmers\u2019 \u201clong march\u201d has been called by Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS) which is affiliated to the CPI (M) and the farmers are expected to reach Mumbai on Sunday. On Friday, the farmers reached Bhatsa river in Thane district where over 5,000 people from Palghar district joined the march. The farmers had started their march on Tuesday from the CBS Chowk in Nashik, the location of the March 2016 demonstration when close to one lakh farmers had gathered for two days. The farmers will cover 35 kilometers daily, on an average.\nSome of the demands of the farmers include a complete farm loan waiver, transfer of forest land to tillers, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission\u2019s recommendations, compensation of Rs 40,000 per acre to farmers hit by hailstorm and pink bollworm, and putting a stop to sharing the state\u2019s water with Gujarat. Apart from middle-aged farmers and youngsters, a large number of women and senior citizens are part of the march. The Peasants and Workers Party and CPI also extended support to the long march. About one lakh people are likely to join the march when it reaches Mumbai, claimed ABKS leaders.\nAjit Nawale, the state general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said though these demands were raised two years ago, there has been no progress. \u201cWe don\u2019t want announcements, we want it to happen. We have given enough time to the state government to act on our issues. Now, we will not leave the Assembly premises until our issues are resolved,\u201d said Nawale, adding that many farmers would join the march over the next two days.\nJP Gavit, a CPI(M) legislator from Kalwan constituency in Nashik, said the state should improve implementation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006. \u201cThough the Act came in 2006 and the rules came in 2008, the government is not implementing it effectively. As per the Act, only 5 or 10 gunthas is being given to farmers, which is nothing. The farmers can\u2019t do anything with it. We just want the land that tribals have been tilling for decades to be given to them. It may be five, seven or ten acres,\u201d said Gavit.\nGavit said they oppose any move to share river water with Gujarat through agreements. \u201cInstead of giving water to Gujarat, it should be diverted to drought-hit parts of the state,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra police played down the number of farmers taking part in the agitation. According to a senior police officer, the crowd at Thane was not more than 20,000. However, this is set to increase multi-fold when the march reaches Mumbai. The official added that they expect around 50,000 to 60,000 protestors in Mumbai.
